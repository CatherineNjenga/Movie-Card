## About
Movie Card is a movies recommendation website based on [Studio Ghibli's API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#section/Studio-Ghibli-API).

## Objectives
* To learn how to use RESTful APIs
* Building a project with React

## Built with
* React.js
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML

## Key Features
* Front-end(React)
* APIs(Studio Ghibli)

## Challenges Encountered
* Adding the flip feature using React and CSS. I had purposed to only utilize React and CSS when adding the feature instead of using the ReactCardFlip compoment (a TypeScript npm).
* Fetching Studio Ghibli's API using React. I initially only understood how to fetch using vanilla JavaScript.

## Future Features
* Include the movies' poster at the front of the flip-card.

## Getting Started
To get the site running locally:
* Clone this repository
* `cd` into `movie-card`
* Run `npm install` for installation of dependencies
* Run `npm start` to run the application in a production environment
* Start application by running `npm start`
